step 1. create templates directory in myapp and create all the html files in it.

step 2. create function in views.py file to call html pages like:

	def indexpage(request):
    		return render(request,"index.html")

step 3. create a new py file called urls.py in myapp directory and create path for html files like:

	from django.urls import path
	from . import views
	urlpatterns = [
    		path('', views.indexpage,name="index"),
    		path('about',views.aboutpage,name="about")
	]

step 4. go to urls.py in project directory import include with this header "from django.urls import path, include" and write a new path in urlpatterns data-dictonary like :

	"path("",include("myapp.urls"))"
